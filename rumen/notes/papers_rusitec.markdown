### Design and development of a long term rumen simulation technique

*Czerkawski*

* Claim that steady state, which produces similar leves of fermentation products as a cow, lasts for 49 d
* Wanted to develop a reactor that contained solids and that was mixed, that was gas tight etc.
* Cyclinders in a water bath that is maintained at 39C.
* The container is moved up and down by a crank connected to a motor.
* Seems to be bags of food dangling on the inside moving up and down. This gets replaced every two days.
* Physiological values of PhD range from 6.5 - 7.5.
* The ratios of VFA changed with the dilution rate.

### Evaluation of methane inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol and monensin (2016)

*Romero-perez*

* Reactor fed a combination of grain (85%), silage (10%) and vitamins.

> Silage is made by one or more of the following methods: placing cut green vegetation in a silo or pit; piling the vegetation in a large heap and compressing it down so as to purge as much oxygen as possible, then covering it with a plastic sheet; or by wrapping large round bales tightly in plastic film.

* Had two RUSITECS, each had 2 treatments randomly assigned to two fermenters.
* 4 treatments, each of n=4
* Here, they had a 8 day adaptation period, followed by 6 days of the experiment.
* Methane was decreased by 75-77%
* Here, the feed of the cows was the same as what was giving to the fermenters.
* They pooled the inoculom from different animals. This is something we could considering doing to average out animals specific population levels in the inolculum.
* They analyzed the data with a mixed model. They say what was included in each model and say that the apparatus was random.

### Effects of Yucca schidigera extract on fermentation and degradation of steroidal saponins in the rumen simulation technique

*Wang*

* Here the inoculum was ruminent fluid that was strained through a cheese cloth then centrifuged.
* 8 vessel RUSITEC with a n=4
* They used a one way ANOVA here and "the least squared means were tested for differences".
* They add a plant extract that is supposed to eliminate the protozoa. It seems like this extract only had a temporary effect.

### On the effects of Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat and wheat chaff on nutrient utilisation and turnover of deoxynivalenol and zearalenone in vitro

*Seeling*

* Tested the effect of 50-100 times DON and ZEN using the rusitec.
* The degradation of organic matter, protein, and fiber was increased with the mycotoxins.
* There was also an increase in ammonia, butyrate, isobutyrate and isovallerate.
* High proportions of ingested DON of 90% (85–93%) and ingested ZON of 93% (80–104%) were recovered at the pooled feed residues and effluents in form of DON and de-epoxy DON, and ZON and α-ZOL after administering the Fusarium toxin contaminated feed.

* Ruminants are quite resistant to DON and ZEN, which is thought to be because of the microbiome.
* Used a ANOVA for the time dependant changes in mycotoxin residues.
* DON and depoxy-DON accumulated over the course of the experiment in the effluent. This happend pretty quickly, over the course of 24 hrs to a couple days.
* However, the toxic potential of ZON is not necessarily reduced by its ruminal transformation because α-ZOL, α-ZAL and β-ZAL have a higher estrogenic potential than ZON.
* The DON migrates to the effluent, which is good.
* Possibly the rumen microorganisms require an adaptation period to acquire their full de-epoxidation ability, which could explain the higher level of de-epoxidation after the longer exposure to contaminated feed.
* It is thought that combination of the grain with the fungus, increases the ammonia, because it increases the available protein content.
* 67% of the DON ended up being de-epoxy DON.

### Rumen microbial abundance and fermentation profile during severe subacute ruminal acidosis and its modulation by plant derived alkaloids in vitro

*Mickdam*

* Protozoa and fungi were more sensitive to Ph than bacteria
* SARA surpressed the degradation of the fiber
* SARA also surpressed methane production
* Cows get SARA when they are fed diets rich in concentrated
* SARA is extended periods below 5.6 - 5.8 ph
* SARA leads to inflamation
* Thinks that plants rich in secondary compounds can play a protective role
* Used a change-over design? Also said that they used a 2*3 factorial design.
This included 2 incubation conditions and 3 diets. 6 treatments.
* 6 vesels in each experimental run. 3 experimental runs. Does this mean n =3?
* Report that SARA caused a large decrease in the amount of Ruminoccocus albus
and Fibrobactor succinogens (80-90%).
* SARA increased the abundances of Lactobabillus and Magaspaera 11-fold. Seems to be much more important for the Lactobaccili.
* SARA decreased several SCFAs, particularly acetate (half of the concentration)
* Less of all gases and ammonia
* Degradation of everything went down essentially

**Discussion**

* Say that Lactobaccilus goes from starch to lactate, which then Magasspaera goes from lactate to propanioate.
* Elevated provetella? This has been suggested as a probiotic.
* Number of methanogens actually didn't change.
* S.ruminantium also increased with is apparently also a lactic acid producer.
