### Cultivation and sequencing of rumen microbiome members from the Hungate1000 Collection

_Seshadri_

-   At the beginning of the project reference genomes were available for only 14 bacteria and one methanogen
-   Members include 9 pyhla, 48 families and 82 genera
-   Polysaccharide degrading genera were stated to be Butyrivibrio, Prevotella and Ruminococus
-   Members of the Fermicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla predominate the rumen
-   A core microbiome of 7 abundant genus-level groups was defined for 67% of the Global Rumen Census Sequences (in order):
    1.  Prevotella (Bacteroidetes)
    2.  Unclassified Clostridiales (Fermicutes)
    3.  Unclassified Bacteroidetes
    4.  Unclassified Ruminococcaceae (Fermicutes)
    5.  Unclassified Lachnospiraceae (Fermicutes)
    6.  Ruminococcus (Fermicutes)
    7.  Butyrivibrio (Fermicutes)
-   As an example, Bacteroides ovatus (over 320 glycoside hydrolases and lyases), where Lachnospiraceae bacterium has 296.
-   The bacteroidetes have evolved polysaccharide utilization loci, genomis regions that encode all the required components for binding, transport, and depolymerization.
-   Many hungate strains were shared between rumen and human instestinal microbiome samples.
-   47 isolates capable of B12 synthesis
-   A further 140 genomes encode the enzymes for the salvage of B12 from an intermediate
-   B12 required as a co-factor for enzymes involved in glucoegenesis from propionate in the liver.
-   Rumen microbes are likely to be vertically inherited, whereas human intestinal isolates are transmitted from other sources in the environment.

### Rumen Microbiome Composition Determined Using Two Nutritional Models of Subacute Ruminal Acidosis

_Khafipour_

-   SARA is low pH but lactic acid does not actually build up such as in acidosis
-   Thought that 19% of early lactating cows and 26% mid lactating cows suffer from acidosis. Slightly lower but essentially the same in Germany and the Netherlands.
-   In the acute form lactic acid accumulates, which is usually caused from switching from high-forage to grain based diet.
-   SARA is checked via rumen ph, free rumen LPS and heptaglobin as an inflammatory marker.
-   Increase in Lachnospiraceae massively in the SARA condition.
-   Lactobacillus, E.coli and Streptococcus bovis also increased in the acidosis.
-   SARA is caused by low starch diets.
-   S.bovis most closely mirrored the severity of SARA
-   Believe that E.coli is the strongest contributor to the disease state in the severe version of the disease.

### Subacute ruminal acidosis in dairy cows: The physiological causes, incidence and consequences

_Plaizier_

-   SARA = accumulation of volatile fatty acids to to insufficient buffering.
-   Thought to be due to highly fermentable sugars
-   Cows have reduced fiber digestion and milk fat. Diarrehea, laminitis, liver abcesses, bacterial endotoxin and inflamation.
-   More concentrates and less forages is to keep up with milk production, which leads to an accumulation of organic acids.
-   Rumen ph can also be measured with a stomach tube or by rumencentesis (sample rumen with a needle).
-   The organic acids include volatile fatty acids and lactic acid.
-   Saliva contains inorganic buffers (sodium bicarbonate) which helps neutralize the rumen
-   Rumen papillae absorb the acids, so the size of these decide how fast the acids can be absorbed.
-   There is a reduction in milk far and protein, which can lead to a loss of $400 per cow per day.
-   Decrease DM intake can be a sign of SARA
-   Decreased fiber digestion also a sign of SARA, which they say is caused by a decrease in the fiberlytic bacteria with cannot survive a phd lower than 6.
-   Mild fat depression is associated with a reduction in the acetate to propanoate ratio (simply because there is more propanoate)
-   There is also more production of trans-octadecenoic acids = incomplete biohydrogenation of fatty acids

### Induction of Subacute Ruminal Acidosis Affects the Ruminal Microbiome and Epithelium

_McCann_

-   Ph less than 5.6 for 3d defines SARA
-   Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Prevotella bryantii, and Succinimonas amylolytica changed over the days (S.amylotlytica was the most significant)
-   Eubacterium ruminantium was greater in SARA cows
-   No effect on Megasphaera elsdenii
-   In solid, no effects were observed for the predominant families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae for the fermincutes. For the bacteroides, Prevotella drove the changes.
-   Lactobacillus decreased with SARA on day 6
-   Say that the biggest effects were observed in the solid faction. Do we need to sample the solid fraction then as well in the RUSITEC?
-   More provetella predisposes the rumen to SARA?
-   More biotin metabolism in SARA?
-   Similar to Khafipour, Anaerovibrio lipolytica and P. bryantii increased on day 6.
-   The 2.7 fold increase in S. bovis for SARA cows on day 6 coincided with a 2.3 fold increase in M. elsdenii supporting a level of synchrony between lactate producers and utilizers that may have prevented a more severe bout of SARA from developing after an abrupt feed restriction.
-   Increase in Sphingolipid metabolism?

 ### Rumen microbial community composition varies with diet and host, but a core microbiome is found across a wide geographical range

 _Henderson_

 - 3.5 billion domesticated ruminants world wide
 - Methanogens metabolize the H from the other microbes
 - Methane emitted represents a 2-12% loss of feed energy from the animal
 - Say that outside of the Butyivibrio, that the groups are not well represented by characterized cultures.
 - Claim that the methanogens for the most part were the same across the samples.
 - Protozoal communities were the opposite, where the prozoal diversity between animals was much greater as compared to bacteria or archaea.
 - Ruminococcus was fair evenly distributed across the samples
 - Clostridiales were most abundant in forage diets, and least abundant in concentrate diets. Same with Fibrobacter.
 - Strong association between succinate-producing Succinivibrionaceae and the succinate user Dialister.

 ### Lactobacilli Are Prominent Members of the Microbiota Involved in the Ruminal Digestion of Barley and Corn

 _Yang_

- Compared different low and high grain diets.
- Lactobacilli were the dominant members of the mature biofilms associated with corn and barley and were accompanied by a notable increase in Megaspaera.
- Non of the cows however exhibited acidosis.
- When digesting, ruminants form biofilms on barley.
- Added the food in nylon bags in the rumen, and then looked at the bacteria that clung onto the food.
- Measure DM before and after.
- Lactobacillus also seemed to associate more with barley than corn. Apparently the starch in barley is more accessible (less tightly associate with the protein matrix)
- Apparently the proteolytic activity of Prevotella is well documented.
- Prevotella were also predominant digesters of grains.
