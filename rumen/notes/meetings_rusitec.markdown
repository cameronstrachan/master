### Notes from conversation with BIOMIN

- There is 2 hours of work everyday just to run the system (stop pump, change the feeding bags etc.)
- Fluid samples are simply taken though valves. The sampling of the solid seems more complicated. Currently, they are using a "detachment protocol", developed by a bachelor student there, which aims to remove the bacteria from the solid.
- pH and total gas is monitored online. They can monitor redox potential online, but have not found this to be worth it.
- Offline, they determine the gases (Methane, CO2) via infrared and quantify SCFAs. They also regularly do total bacterial counts (flow cytometry) with live / dead and gram staining. They also look at organic matter degradation by drying and weighing the bag contents.
- The third Mycotoxin that they want to test is Enniatin, a cyclic depsipeptide.
- The first run in February will be simply a test run (not part of the project, not sure if anything will be tested).
- They have a DNA extraction protocol for RUSITEC samples, which seems to take most of a day for a batch of samples (the protocol is simply some bead bashing and a few added steps before a Qiagen kit).
- They have been running the RUSITEC for 12 days usually, with a maximum of 15 days.
- They are able to do a really nice 24hr "SARA" switch in the middle of the experiment, which then recovers to the regular pH. I wonder if we could do 2 switches and see if the community is more resilient to the second switch, as is seen in cows? Regardless, 24hr is nice for mimicking the diurnal pH cycle, which is observed in cows that have been fed concentrates. Since this switch (the buffering parameters) is set up and dramatically increases the chance that we see changes with the mycotoxins (or any changes at all), I think it will be very important to do and BIOMIN agrees. Prof Zebeli has said we should not do it and so we will need to see if we can provide him with some good arguments.
- A first test design of 4 conditions (factorial screening experiment) with 2 runs (2 different mycotoxin treatments):

  1. mycotoxins pool (DON/ZEN in first run, Enniatin in the second run). Start with testing only the highest concentration (BIOMIN currently proposed 2 x EU guidelines).
  2. mycotoxin pool + 24hr SARA challenge
  3. 24hr SARA challenge alone
  4. control (no mycotoxins or SARA challenge)
- BIOMIN has been doing some qPCR to monitor Protozoa and Fibrolytic bacteria. I suggested that will the availability of genomes now (Hungate project), I could design primers and greatly expand the panel of qPCR assays.
- I also suggested that we try FISH on the solid fraction samples.
- Lastly, I brought up the cow inoculum, which they wanted to improve on. In the past, they had simply taken samples from whatever cows were available at the slaughter house and pooled them. They agreed this was not ideal. I suggested that we select a single cow from the farm and sequence her regularly (as Evelyne proposed), which they agreed with.

### Talking with Vicki afterwards

- I talked to Vicki after the BIOMIN meeting and she had a bunch of really good advice. One of the main things we suggested was that if we go with a single cow and sequence her rumen during the experiment, we should do a small feeding experiment in parallel to the RUSITEC trial on her. This would mean giving the single cow concentrates at 10 am, which will swing the pH down throughout the day and recover by morning (the same time frame that BIOMIN is doing on the RUSITEC). The best time to sample here would be at 12-14 hrs, which is when I would also sample the RUSITEC (in the middle of the pH drop). This side experiment would give us a really good idea of which populations of bacteria are represented in the RUSITEC and which the SARA model impacts in both the cow and RUSITEC. One question is whether we will detect significant changes in the community after 12hrs with the pH switch (this will depend on things such as the doubling time).
- Another point this brings up is the feed bags. Can we make this match the cow diet? Then, can we add concentrate when we do the transient acidosis?
