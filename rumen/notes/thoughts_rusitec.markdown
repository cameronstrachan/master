### Notes from Biomin

* Proposal is not obligatory, only the non-specific milestones and deliverables
* Can perform up to 9 runs (full experiments)
* They want to emphasize acidic conditions and wonder if this may effect the transformation of the mycotoxins.
* Combined DON+ZEN treatment is possible.
* They simulate acidic conditions with the starch-rich diet, but also need to dilute the buffer to decrease the ph. The idea here is to similuate high-performing cows and high-performing cows with acidosis.
* They said that the system should be ready within 2018.
* The unit has 12 chambers.
* It seems like Biomin has done some work on the qPCR of protozoans.

### Thoughts form literature

* Start with a screening experiment, which uses up to 20% of the sequencing data.
* The DON and ZEN treatment have a low probability of having a strong effect.
* Since interested in large effect sizes, n=3 or n=4 is likely sufficient. n=4 is more common in the literature.
* SARA is known to inhibit a lot of degradation, especially in the of hydrolases. With the specific mechanisms acting on DON and ZEN, I'm not sure how the lower ph would be expected to change the activity, however, it is know that a fungal lactohydrolase acting on ZEN is inhibited at a ph of 4.5. And obviously, all enzymes, especially oxidases, have ph optimum, so assuming that ph with affect the degradation ability is probably safe.
* In both rusitec and in vivo acidosis experiments, there is definitely a consistent increase in Lactobacillus (also true to a lesser extent for Magasspaera). This is thought to make sense has Lactobacillus takes starch to lactate, and then Magasspaera from Lactate to propanoate.
* There is also a consistent increase for the very abundant Provetella byantii.
* In just in vivo experiments, S.bovis increases with acidosis. S.bovis is also a lactic acid bacterium.
* In terms of culturing, Lactobacillus in falcutatively anaerobic, but provetella are anaerobic. With that said, many bacteroides are very aerotolerant, meaning that many manipulations can be done on the bench top. Interestingly, there are some negative correlation with the Prevotella and the Lactobacillus, where in osteomyelitis in mice  is correlated with an increase in Prevotella and a reduction in Lactobacillus.


### Thoughts from analysis

* In terms of reanalyzing data, maybe I could focus on making sure that the diet is included in the meta data associated with the sequence data. Then I could try grouping them based on the likelihood of acidosis.
* In Evelyn's rusitec experiments, there was approximately 1600 unique tags. 50% of the data was represented by 128 tags, and 10% of the data was represented by 12 tags.

### Questions for Biomin or VetMed

* Is it possible to match the reactor and cow diet.
* Which metabolites can we monitor at BIOMIN? DON and it's derivatives? ZEN and it's derivatives? SCFA?
* In Dr. Zabeli's paper, it took 3 days for the ph to normalize to below 5.8. Does BIOMIN have a good idea of how to get the ph to 5.8 and to hold it there?
* Should we be sampling the solid fraction? Some recent evidence suggestions that ...

### Thoughts from anlysis

- Are lactobacillus (or lactic acid bacteria, so including other genera streptococcus) predictors of unhealthy communities. Then, in the global microbiome data set, for example, you can look at what communities which had extreme diets, did not show lactobacillus. What is the community that is resistant to the LAB?
- The lactos (and megas), definitely go up with high starch diets, but are not indicators of acidosis, but maybe the overall level of lactors is an indicator?
