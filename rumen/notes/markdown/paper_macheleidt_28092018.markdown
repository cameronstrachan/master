|---|---|---|


## Summary

* Roles of secondary metabolites include communication signals during co-existence with other microorganisms, virulence factors during pathogenic interaction with plants and animals and medical applications.
* Extensive review of regulation

### Notes

**focus on section on the role of secondary metabolites**

* Often produce the secondary metabolites in response to stress.
* Can mediate communication within or between species, defense against competitors, nutrient aquisition, and even symbiotic interactions.
* In _Aspergillus nidulans_, of 68 cluster indentified, products are only known for 20 of them.
* Deoxynivalenol and gliotoxin are virulence determinants.
* Butyrolactone I is known as a communication molecules.
* Penicillin is thought to be for defence ("thereby structuring microbial consortia").

### Interaction with other microorganisms

* Little is know about the role of antibiotics in nature.
* Penicillin was in fact discovered based on the antibiosis against Staphylococcus.
* Abrudan _et al._ clearly demonstrated enhanced antibiotic production in Streptomyces in response to signal received by neighbouring microorganisms.
* The mycotoxin fusaric acid represses antimicrobial activity in Pseudomonas fluorescences.
* Lovastin production in _A.terreus_ was increased by adding butyrolactones I to liquid cultures (is this a quorum sensing molecule?).
* Can fungi upset bacterial quorum sensing?
* New secondary metabolites were produced when _A.nidulans_ was cultured with the soil dwelling _S.rapamycinicus_, by activatin the orsellinic acid gene cluter. Interestingly, physical contact is required.
