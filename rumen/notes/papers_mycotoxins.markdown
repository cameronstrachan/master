### Regulation and Role of Secondary Metabolites

_Fox_

-   Roles of secondary metabolites include communication signals during co-existence with other microorganisms, virulence factors during pathogenic interaction with plants and animals and medical applications.
-   Extensive review of regulation

**Focus on section on the role of secondary metabolites**

-   Often produce the secondary metabolites in response to stress.
-   Can mediate communication within or between species, defense against competitors, nutrient aquisition, and even symbiotic interactions.
-   In _Aspergillus nidulans_, of 68 cluster indentified, products are only known for 20 of them.
-   Deoxynivalenol and gliotoxin are virulence determinants.
-   Butyrolactone I is known as a communication molecules.
-   Penicillin is thought to be for defence ("thereby structuring microbial consortia").

**Interaction with other microorganisms**

-   Little is know about the role of antibiotics in nature.
-   Penicillin was in fact discovered based on the antibiosis against Staphylococcus.
-   Abrudan _et al._ clearly demonstrated enhanced antibiotic production in Streptomyces in response to signal received by neighbouring microorganisms.
-   The mycotoxin fusaric acid represses antimicrobial activity in Pseudomonas fluorescences.
-   Lovastin production in _A.terreus_ was increased by adding butyrolactones I to liquid cultures (is this a quorum sensing molecule?).
-   Can fungi upset bacterial quorum sensing?
-   New secondary metabolites were produced when _A.nidulans_ was cultured with the soil dwelling _S.rapamycinicus_, by activatin the orsellinic acid gene cluter. Interestingly, physical contact is required.

### Secondary metabolism:regulation and role in in fungal biology

_Macheleidt_

-   The role of secondary metabolites in fungi remains a mystery.
-   Many of the fungi live saprophytically in soil.
-   Speculate that the metabolites protect against other inhabitants in their ecologial niche.
-   Summarizes some of the regulatory factors invovled in the expression of various secondary metabolites.
-   Aflotoxin and fumonisins are polyketides (many mycotoxins are polyketides)
-   Sirodesmin, peramine and siderophores are non-ribosomal peptides
-   T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) are terpenes.

-   Many genes times the biosynthetic cultures are expressed at such low levels that it is hard to detect the product under standard culture conditions.
-   Compounds invovled in iron uptake (siderophores) are often involved in virulence.
-   Say that the compounds protect against amoebae, nematodes and other invertebrates, for example.

### Colon Microbiome of Pigs Fed Diet Contaminated with Commercial Purified Deoxynivalenol and Zearalenone

_Reddy_

-   3 groups of PIGS, 1 group fed DON (8mg/kg) and 1 group was fed ZEN (8mg/kg)
-   Lactobacillus was more dominant in the DON group (7.6%) and also in the ZEN group (2.7%)
-   They speculate that the lactobacillus detoxifies DON and ZEN in pigs, but as far as I have learned, there is much less detoxification in pigs compared to cows.
-   They say that PIGS are exposed to more DON and ZEN, because they eat more cereals.
-   Megaphaera was more abundant in the ZEN group, but not the DON.
-   Increase in the proteobacteria in the ZEN group.
-   Control n=4, DON n=5 and ZEN n=5

### Effects and biotransformation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in growing pigs fed with naturally contaminated pelleted grains with and without the addition of Coriobacteriaceum DSM 11798

_Sayyari_

-   Adding 1-5mg of DON has a significant impact on pigs food intake (20-28% decrease).
-   Addition of the strain didn't do anything.
-   DON is a trichothecene
-   They think that there is something to do with the feed pellets, which kept the bacteria from releasing.

### Expression of the Clonostachys rosea lactonohydrolase gene by Lactobacillus reuteri to increase its zearalenone-removing ability

_Yang_

-   Transferred a ZEN degrading enzyme produced by Clonostachys rosea into Lactobacillus (with an E.coli shuttle vector). The plasmid was then put into a probiotic bacillus strain isolated from broilers (chicken)
-   Use a lactohydrolase, which is from a fungi
-   The enzyme losing activity at phs below 4.5. Maybe enzymes that act on DON and ZEN in the Rumen also loose their activity at low phs?
-   MRS media is a agar specific to culturing lactobacillus

### Binding Rather Than Metabolism May Explain the Interaction of Two Food-Grade Lactobacillus Strains with Zearalenone and Its Derivative

_El-nezami_

-   Used two food grade strains of Lactobacillus where incubated with ZEN.
-   Binding, rather than any metabolism, was responsible for removing the toxin.
-   ZEN and its derivative likely bound the same site on the bacteria.
-   ZEN is thought to be responsible for early puberty induction of kids in peurto rico.
-   I don't think they compared to other bacteria, so I'm not sure we can trust this result.
