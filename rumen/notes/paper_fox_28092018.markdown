|---|---|---|

## Summary

* The role of secondary metabolites in fungi remains a mystery.
* Many of the fungi live saprophytically in soil.
* Speculate that the metabolites protect against other inhabitants in their ecologial niche.
* Summarizes some of the regulatory factors invovled in the expression of various secondary metabolites.

### Notes

* Aflotoxin and fumonisins are polyketides (many mycotoxins are polyketides)
* Sirodesmin, peramine and siderophores are non-ribosomal peptides
* T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) are terpenes.

* Many genes times the biosynthetic cultures are expressed at such low levels that it is hard to detect the product under standard culture conditions.
* Compounds invovled in iron uptake (siderophores) are often involved in virulence.
* Say that the compounds protect against amoebae, nematodes and other invertebrates, for example.
