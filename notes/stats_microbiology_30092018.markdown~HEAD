### Introduction

* An observation is a measurement, which can be qualitative or quantitative.
* A sample is a gruop of observations drawn from a population. The membership of a population depends on what is being studied and is defined as soon as the studied is defined.
* Reproduing the results mean to take another sample from the same population.
* Most of the populations sampled in lab experiments are infinite populations! (ex. E.coli)

**Frequency tables**

* Table of the number of observations or fraction of total observations
* Often grouped based on ranges (ex. every 5 grams)

**Histogram**
* If measurements continuous, can represent with a histogram.
* If intervals are uneven, need to adjust to make sure that the area under the bar is proportional to the frequency.
