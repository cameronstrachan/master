- Someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your computer files and understand in detail what you did and why. 
- subdirectories in results and data should simply be dates
- computational lab notebook in results directory
- record every operation in a README
- avoid editing intermediate files by hand
- store all files and directory locations in the drivers script / readme
(i should fix my sripts to conform with this, it makes sense)
- use relative path names (starting form the projects directory), so that the project works on other peoples computers

four categories of scripts:
	- driver script, top level, one or scripts of this type
	- single use script, in the same directory as the driver that calls it
	- project script (generic functionaliry, usually in a directory one below project called bin, for example)
	- multiproject script
