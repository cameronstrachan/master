**Lesson 1**

* If we had infinite time and money, we probably wouldn't care about design of experiments.
* Randomization: assigning your treatments and controls by some random process.
* Replication: always want to control or estimate the uncertainty in results. When you can't reduce error, than increase N.
* Blocking is including other variables which may contribute to the variation. Helps to avoid biases and account for noise.
* Multi-factor designs: this is contrary to the scientific method, whereby everything is held constant and one thing is tested at a time. It is better to design an experiment that simultaneously includes combinations of multiple factors. Then you can aslo learn about the interaction between factors.
* Counfouding: this is like the shoe sole example.

* Experimental factors are those that you can specify, and classification factors are simply those that you can label.

* Never invest more than 25% of resources into the first experiment.

**Lesson 2**

* Engineers express the t-test as a signal to noise ratio. The t-statistic is the signal to noise ratio.
* A paired t-test is the simplest example of a block.
* Power is the probability of rejecting the null when the alternative hypothesis is infact true.
* The R package power lets you calculate the power.
